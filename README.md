# Installation instructions

Tested using python 3.6.2. You need to have installed the module requests: http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/

# Usage

The file GeniTools is the one I am using as main programme. It is not yet very stable, but the libraries are getting. Juse use the input file "INPUT_TEMPLATE" and select as input inside the script GeniTools.py, the input file needs to include the Geni token and the starting profile.

In order to get the token just go here: https://www.geni.com/platform/developer/api_explorer and introduce it in the input file as GENIKEY. Notice that the key gets updated almost everyday... so everytime you are using this script you will need to do it.
